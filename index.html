            <h2>Overcoming Challenges</h2>
            <p class="main-text">
                From the outside, it looks like the Stanwood girl’s swim team is 
                super successful. They are undefeated this year for the first time 
                in Stanwood swim history. One thing people don’t look at is how 
                much success they have, not just statistically. The Stanwood girl’s 
                swim team is constantly making goals everyday and they are reaching 
                them, they are pushing themselves and their teammates to be better, 
                making more goals to work towards. Senior Sarah Zastoupil explains 
                that, “over the summer, [she] had a goal of reaching a time of 500 
                and leading lane six during the high school season”. She put in the
                work all summer and achieved that goal. When asking coach Rita 
                Peterson about challenges, she reveals that “the main challenges 
                high school athletes have to face is balancing school, family, 
                and sometimes work”. Balance is a challenge for anyone, and 
                that is one thing the Stanwood girl’s swim team is amazing at 
                overcoming. Senior Faith Dilworth adds that one thing athletes 
                have to face is “time management, as well as mental stress”. She 
                understands the challenges and she, as well as the rest of the 
                team, has overcome time management and handles stress very well.

            <h2>Memories</h2>
            <p class="main-text">
                The Stanwood girl’s swim team has made some amazing memories over 
                their excellent season. Freshman Anna Paul’s favorite memory is 
                their “team sleepover”. It made them grow closer and it was a really 
                fun night. Faith Dilworth’s favorite memory was their “high stakes 
                meet against Glacier Peak”. Coach Peterson agrees with that as that
                 is also her favorite memory. She said that something special about
                  this was, finding out that they had “beat Glacier Peak, who had 
                  won 40 meets in a row, and knowing that [they] had broken that 
                  winning streak”. That memory had proven to themselves that they 
                  were capable of more than they thought. They realized how good 
                  they really were and how far they could really make it. Two years
                   ago they lost to Glacier Peak by 120 points and this year they
                    beat them 88-82. The depth of their team has helped them so 
                    much and it is exciting for the Stanwood community to see a 
                    growing program.

            <h2>Family and Culture</h2>
            <p class="main-text">
                The Stanwood girl’s swim team has built an absolutely 
                amazing program. After watching just 10 minutes of a 
                practice or meet, you can see the culture they have 
                created. After talking with their team they also feel 
                the strong culture of their team. In almost every 
                question asked, culture and chemistry is brought up. 
                Senior Faith Dilworth says, “we all support each other 
                really well” and “we have a really good community and 
                the coaches always help you reach your goals”. Senior 
                Sarah Zastoupil says, “my teammates are the ones 
                helping me beat my goals”, adding on that “one time 
                they even helped me swim two more laps after I thought 
                I couldn’t keep going”. Freshman Anna Paul says that 
                her favorite part of practice is just being in a lane 
                with such amazing girls. She says that, “they are a 
                good group of people and they help you to keep going”. 
                Coach Peterson says, “they have many diverse 
                personalities”. They have 40 girls on the team 
                and she says “they work together and support each 
                other”. She comments on how their team is successful 
                because of “how hard they train together” and she sees 
                “swimmers push themselves past where they thought they 
                could go during tough sets”.
